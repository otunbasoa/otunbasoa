## Professional Journey
🌐 I am a DevOps Engineer with 3 years of experience and a strong interest in cloud technologies. I work with AWS and DigitalOcean to build and manage infrastructure, and I use tools like Ansible, Terraform, and Jenkins to automate deployment and testing. I enjoy working in agile teams and continuously improving systems, and I’m looking for a role where I can contribute to a team’s success while growing my skills. 

## Personal Interests
📚 Outside of my professional pursuits, I have a passion for reading and exploring the fascinating world of business. Whether it's learning how to fly a plane or trying to figure out the weather, I'm always eager to learn something new.

## Cloud Enthusiast
☁️ My passion for cloud computing goes beyond my job. I actively learn, engage in meaningful discussions, and participate in cloud-related meetups and conferences. If you're seeking a Cloud Engineer or interested in collaborating, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
